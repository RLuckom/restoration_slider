The main directory of this project has a file called "index.html" for testing different images in the slider.

To test new images, replace the src attribute of the two ```<img>``` tags in the ```<div>``` element with the id "imgs," and open index.html in a browser.

Note that the javascript currently checks to make sure that there are exactly two images within the div, and that the images are exactly the same size, to the pixel.

A demo is currently live at [Allied Conservation's
website](http://alliedconservation.com/?page_id=565).
